This is still in an early stage of development.

*** TODO Grading rules

    At least 5.5 for exam to pass. Grade is max of exam grade and weighted average of exam and assignments

    Assignments weight in total 20 %.

*** TODO Assignments

    one third simple, one third exam level, one third hard. Passing parts 1 and 2 accumulates up to an eight


    
*** TODO Memoryless excursions (Wietze)

    Ready for feedback. Feel free to put you name behind this if you like reviewing this. First review on a high level. Once things are organized, we repair the details.

*** TODO Notes

    Read for feedback. Similar to previous point.

    
*** TODO tutorials

    - Tutorials will be replaced by solving problems during the lectures. There will be one lecture a week.
    - We need to organize something like office hours for questions so that students can ask questions. I think it would be a good idea to assemble these questions to set up a system of hints
    - Can we use github discussions instead of the nestor discussion board? I like many things of github over nestor.


    

*** TODO Things to setup
- Enable students to turn in assignments in nestor, so that we can grade them
- Make assignments, review, assemble feedback and grade
- Make an exam and a resit, review and grade
- Make a tool to form student groups. (Nicky)
